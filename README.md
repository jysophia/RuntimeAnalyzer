### Java Parser Sample Instructions for execution

- Requires the use of maven for some reason.

1) Download Maven using homebrew

- `brew install maven`

2) Once maven is installed run this command

- `mvn clean install`

3) This creates a target folder to which you can directly run the project in the terminal.

- `java -jar target/javaparser-maven-sample-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`

4) Running the command from step 3, will create an output folder, which contains the modified java file.
